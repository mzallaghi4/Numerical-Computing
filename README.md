## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have Julia installed on your machine.
You can download Julia from the official website: https://julialang.org/downloads/.


You can explore the code examples and tutorials in the `notebooks`. To run a notebook, open a terminal, navigate to the `notebooks` directory, and launch the Julia REPL by typing `julia`. Then, enter the following commands:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".")
Pkg.instantiate()
```

You can then run a notebook by entering the following command:

```julia
using IJulia
notebook()
```

This will launch Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser. You can then navigate to the notebook you want to run and execute the cells.

## Topics Covered

The following topics are covered in this repository:
* Root finding
* Interpolation
